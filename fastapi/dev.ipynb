       "[{'snippet': 'In the rapidly evolving AI era with large language models (LLMs) at the core, making LLMs more trustworthy and efficient, especially in output generation (inference), has gained significant attention. This is to reduce plausible but faulty LLM outputs (a.k.a hallucinations) and meet the highly increased inference demands. This tutorial explores such efforts and makes them transparent to the database community. Understanding these efforts is essential in harnessing LLMs in database tasks and adapting database techniques to LLMs. Furthermore, we delve into the synergy between LLMs and databases, highlighting new opportunities and challenges in their intersection. This tutorial aims to share with database researchers and practitioners essential concepts and strategies around LLMs, reduce the unfamiliarity of LLMs, and inspire joining in the intersection between LLMs and databases.',\n",

       " {'snippet': \"Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely adopted recently. Research explores their use both as autonomous agents and as tools for software engineering. LLM-integrated applications, on the other hand, are software systems that leverage an LLM to perform tasks that would otherwise be impossible or require significant coding effort. While LLM-integrated application engineering is emerging as new discipline, its terminology, concepts and methods need to be established. This study provides a taxonomy for LLM-integrated applications, offering a framework for analyzing and describing these systems. It also demonstrates various ways to utilize LLMs in applications, as well as options for implementing such integrations. Following established methods, we analyze a sample of recent LLM-integrated applications to identify relevant dimensions. We evaluate the taxonomy by applying it to additional cases. This review shows that applications integrate LLMs in numerous ways for various purposes. Frequently, they comprise multiple LLM integrations, which we term ``LLM components''. To gain a clear understanding of an application's architecture, we examine each LLM component separately. We identify thirteen dimensions along which to characterize an LLM component, including the LLM skills leveraged, the format of the output, and more. LLM-integrated applications are described as combinations of their LLM components. We suggest a concise representation using feature vectors for visualization. The taxonomy is effective for describing LLM-integrated applications. It can contribute to theory building in the nascent field of LLM-integrated application engineering and aid in developing such systems. Researchers and practitioners explore numerous creative ways to leverage LLMs in applications. Though challenges persist, integrating LLMs may revolutionize the way software systems are built.\",\n",

       " {'snippet': \"The rise of large language models (LLMs) has enabled LLM-based applications (a.k.a. AI agents or co-pilots), a new software paradigm that combines the strength of LLM and conventional software. Diverse LLM applications from different tenants could design complex workflows using multiple LLM requests to accomplish one task. However, they have to use the over-simplified request-level API provided by today's public LLM services, losing essential application-level information. Public LLM services have to blindly optimize individual LLM requests, leading to sub-optimal end-to-end performance of LLM applications. This paper introduces Parrot, an LLM service system that focuses on the end-to-end experience of LLM-based applications. Parrot proposes Semantic Variable, a unified abstraction to expose application-level knowledge to public LLM services. A Semantic Variable annotates an input/output variable in the prompt of a request, and creates the data pipeline when connecting multiple LLM requests, providing a natural way to program LLM applications. Exposing Semantic Variables to the public LLM service allows it to perform conventional data flow analysis to uncover the correlation across multiple LLM requests. This correlation opens a brand-new optimization space for the end-to-end performance of LLM-based applications. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Parrot can achieve up to an order-of-magnitude improvement for popular and practical use cases of LLM applications.\",\n",
